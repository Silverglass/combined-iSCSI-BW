/**
 *	sd_probe - called during driver initialization and whenever a
 *	new scsi device is attached to the system. It is called once
 *	for each scsi device (not just disks) present.
 *	@dev: pointer to device object
 *
 *	Returns 0 if successful (or not interested in this scsi device 
 *	(e.g. scanner)); 1 when there is an error.
 *
 *	Note: this function is invoked from the scsi mid-level.
 *	This function sets up the mapping between a given 
 *	<host,channel,id,lun> (found in sdp) and new device name 
 *	(e.g. /dev/sda). More precisely it is the block device major 
 *	and minor number that is chosen here.
 *
 *	Assume sd_attach is not re-entrant (for time being)
 *	Also think about sd_attach() and sd_remove() running coincidentally.
